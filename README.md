## üìÑ README PDF Automation

### Automated PDF Generation and Cloud Sync

The project includes **fully automated README-to-PDF conversion** with cloud synchronization for tablet annotation workflows.

#### ü§ñ How It Works

1. **README.md updated** ‚Üí Automatically triggers GitHub Action
2. **PDF generated** using `md-to-pdf` with proper formatting  
3. **PDF uploaded to Dropbox** ‚Üí Overwrites previous version (no duplicates)
4. **PDF appears on tablet** ‚Üí Ready for annotation via Dropbox app

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

**GitHub Workflow**: `.github/workflows/readme-to-pdf.yml`
- **Trigger**: `on.push.paths: README.md` - Only runs when README changes
- **PDF Engine**: `md-to-pdf` with headless Chrome rendering
- **Cloud Upload**: Dropbox API with overwrite mode for single-file management
- **Runtime**: ~2-3 minutes per conversion
- **Cost**: Free (within GitHub Actions and Dropbox free tiers)

#### üì± Tablet Workflow

- ‚úÖ **Edit README** ‚Üí PDF automatically updates in Dropbox
- ‚úÖ **Open Dropbox on tablet** ‚Üí Latest PDF ready for annotation  
- ‚úÖ **No manual uploads** ‚Üí Complete automation
- ‚úÖ **No duplicate files** ‚Üí Always overwrites same file (`Knight-Battle-Game-README.pdf`)

#### üîß Setup Requirements

- **Dropbox App** with API token configured as GitHub secret
- **GitHub Actions permissions**: `contents: write`
- **One-time setup** ‚Üí Ongoing automation

#### üöß Implementation Challenges Overcome

- **PDF Generation**: Multiple converter failures resolved with `md-to-pdf`
- **Google Drive API**: Service account storage quota restrictions led to Dropbox adoption
- **YAML Syntax**: JSON formatting in workflow files required careful escaping
- **Action Dependencies**: Non-existent GitHub marketplace actions replaced with direct API calls

This automation eliminates manual PDF generation while providing seamless access to the latest documentation for mobile review and annotation.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Game Systems

### 1. Fighter/Squire System
**Core Concept**: Players equip knights in different roles:
- **Fighter**: Primary combatant who provides stats (HP, Attack) for battle
- **Squire**: Support knight whose passive abilities enhance the fighter
- **Dual Squire System**: With King's Blessing unlocked, players can equip 2 squires simultaneously

**How It Works**:
- Fighter's buffed stats (including duplicate bonuses) are used for battle
- Squire passive effects are applied to the fighter during combat
- Multiple squires stack their passive effects through PassiveManager
- King's Blessing allows second squire slot to be unlocked

### 2. Knight Collection System
- **12 Knights Total**: 3 Common, 3 Rare, 3 Epic, 3 Legendary
- **Duplicate System**: Up to 11 copies per knight
- **Buffs**: Each duplicate gives +10% HP and Attack (max 100% at 11 copies)
- **Evolution**: Knights with 11 copies can evolve to "Evolved" versions
- **Mass Evolution**: Bulk evolve all eligible knights at once from collection screen (FIXED: No longer loses knights)
- **Rarity Filtering**: Filter collection by Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, or Evolved knights

### 3. Passive Effects System
**8 Passive Types** with intelligent stacking:
- `HP_BOOST` - Increases max HP (additive stacking)
- `ATTACK_BOOST` - Increases attack damage (additive stacking)
- `DAMAGE_RESISTANCE` - Reduces incoming damage (additive, capped at 95%)
- `EVASION` - Chance to dodge attacks (additive, capped at 90%)
- `CRITICAL_HIT` - Chance to deal 2x damage (additive, capped at 100%)
- `LIFE_STEAL` - Heal for % of damage dealt (additive, capped at 100%)
- `DOUBLE_ATTACK` - Chance to attack twice (additive, capped at 90%)
- `SCALING_ATTACK` - Attack increases as health decreases (uses highest value, no stacking)

**PassiveManager System**:
- Handles multiple passive effects from multiple squires
- Intelligent stacking rules prevent overpowered combinations
- Comprehensive logging for debugging passive interactions
- Recalculates stats when passives are added or removed

### 4. Battle System
- **3 Attack Types**:
  - Light: 50% damage + 50% stun chance
  - Medium: 100% damage
  - Heavy: 200% damage or miss (50/50)
- **Infinite Progression**: 5 stages per world, infinite worlds
- **Scaling Difficulty**: Each world starts with 2x final boss stats from previous world
- **Coin System**: 10 coins per regular boss, 60 coins for mini boss (stage 5)
- **Surrender Option**: Keep coins when surrendering, lose all when dying
- **Enhanced Animations**: Both player and enemy attack animations with proper timing
- **Enemy Stunning**: Light attacks can stun enemies, causing them to skip their turn
- **Attack Spam Prevention**: Buttons disabled during animations and enemy turns to prevent exploitation

### 5. Chest System
- **Cost**: 5 coins per chest, 45 coins for 10x (10% discount)
- **Drop Rates**: 40% Common, 30% Rare, 20% Epic, 10% Legendary
- **Duplicate Handling**: Automatically merges quantities up to 11 max
- **10x Opening**: Bulk chest opening with summary display
- **Rarity Display**: Visual indicators for knight rarities

### 6. Event System
**Random events occur after completing stages to add variety and strategic elements to progression.**

**Event Mechanics**:
- **No events after stage 1**
- **Stage 2+**: Progressive chance - 20% ‚Üí 40% ‚Üí 60% for stages 2-4
- **After mini boss (stage 5+)**: 100% chance for Life Tree
- **King's Blessing**: Special unlock event (currently 50% chance for testing)

**Current Events**:
1. **Life Tree**
   - **Effect**: Restores all lost health to full
   - **Rarity**: Common (99% chance when event triggers)
   - **Description**: "A mystical tree restores all your lost health!"

2. **King's Blessing** 
   - **Effect**: Unlocks second squire slot permanently
   - **Rarity**: Legendary (1% base chance, 50% for testing)
   - **Description**: "The ancient king grants you the power to command two squires in battle!"
   - **Persistent**: Once unlocked, stays unlocked forever

**Technical Implementation**:
- Events check in `GameActivity.checkBattleResult()` after stage completion
- Event effects applied immediately before showing event screen
- King's Blessing saves unlock status to SharedPreferences
- Player returns to battle after pressing continue
- Smart event selection prevents duplicate King's Blessing

### 7. Enhanced Animation System
**Complete character animation system for both player and enemy with cinematic battle experience.**

**Player Animation Features**:
- **Entrance Animations**: Slides in from left side of screen
- **Attack Animations**: Knight-specific attack frames during combat
- **Victory Sequence**: Walks off screen to the right after victory
- **Knight-Specific Images**: Uses `knight_name_attack.png` and `knight_name_idle.png`

**Enemy Animation Features** (NEW):
- **Entrance Animations**: Slides in from right side with 200ms delay
- **Attack Animations**: Switches between `enemy_idle.png` and `enemy_attack.png`
- **Defeat Sequence**: Falls down while fading out (dramatic)
- **Proper Timing**: Attack animation plays before damage calculation
- **Optimized Sizing**: Enemy properly sized (300x350dp) and positioned

**Animation Technical Details**:
- **Duration**: 800ms entrance animations with smooth deceleration
- **Attack Timing**: 1000ms attack animations with 150ms damage delay
- **Victory Flow**: Enemy dies ‚Üí Enemy falls/fades ‚Üí Player exits right ‚Üí New enemy enters
- **State Management**: Prevents animation overlaps and spam attacks
- **Resource Management**: Automatic fallback to default images if knight-specific images not found

### 8. Attack Spam Prevention System (NEW)
**Comprehensive system to prevent button spam exploitation during battle.**

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- **Immediate Button Disable**: Attack buttons disabled instantly when attack starts
- **State Validation**: Checks `gameOver`, `isPlayerTurn`, `isPlayerAnimating` before allowing attacks
- **Animation Awareness**: Prevents attacks during player attack animations
- **Turn Management**: Buttons stay disabled during enemy turns
- **Safe Re-enabling**: Buttons only re-enabled when truly player's turn

**Technical Implementation**:
```java
// Spam prevention in attack methods
if (gameOver || !isPlayerTurn || isPlayerAnimating) {
    return; // Block the attack
}
disableAttackButtons(); // Immediate disable
```

**Debug Features**:
- Comprehensive logging of button states
- Attack blocking reasons logged
- Animation state tracking

### 9. Collapsible Passive Display System
**Interactive squire passive information display that can be toggled during battle.**

**UI Features**:
- **Compact State (Default)**: Shows minimal squire count (e.g., "üõ°Ô∏è 2/2 Squires Active (Tap to expand)")
- **Expanded State**: Shows full squire details with passive names and descriptions
- **Click to Toggle**: Tap the squire text area to switch between compact/expanded
- **Smart Sizing**: Uses `minLines="1"` for compact, `maxLines="8"` for expanded
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear hints about tap functionality and current state

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration System

### General Knight Migration (MainActivity.java)
```java
// Version-less migration system that runs every startup
private void updateKnightStats() {
    // 1. Fix knight name mismatches with database
    fixKnightNameMismatches(editor);
    // 2. Update ALL knights to match database stats
    updateAllKnightsToDatabase(editor);
}
```

### Name Change Mapping:
```java
private String findCorrectKnightName(String oldName) {
    switch (oldName) {
        case "Brave Knight": return "Axolotl Knight";
        // Add more mappings as needed
        default: return null;
    }
}
```

### Duplicate Knight Cleanup:
- Automatic detection and merging of duplicate knight entries
- Quantity consolidation while respecting 11-copy maximum
- Maintains equipment assignments during cleanup

2. **No migration needed** - passives load fresh from database
3. **Works instantly** for all existing knights
4. **Evolved knights automatically get enhanced versions**

### Add New Passive Types:
1. **Add to `PassiveType` enum** in `Knight.java`
2. **Implement logic** in `Character.java` methods:
   - `takeDamage()` for defensive passives
   - `performAttack()` for offensive passives  
3. **Add to PassiveManager.java** for stacking rules and caps
4. **Add knights** using new passive to `KnightDatabase.java`
5. **Update evolved effects** in `getEvolvedPassiveEffect()`
6. **Add to chest system** in `ChestActivity.java`

**Complexity varies**: Simple passives (poison, stun) vs Complex passives (shields, turn effects)

### Add New Knight:
1. Add to `KnightDatabase.java` static block
2. Add to `ChestActivity.java` availableKnights list
3. Add images: `knight_name_idle.png`, `knight_name_attack.png`

### Add Knight Images:
1. Name files: `display_name_idle.png`, `display_name_attack.png`
2. Convert spaces to underscores, make lowercase
3. Place in `app/src/main/res/drawable/`

### Add Enemy Animation Images:
1. **Required files**: `enemy_idle.png`, `enemy_attack.png`
2. **Recommended size**: Proportional to 300x350dp display size
3. **Place in**: `app/src/main/res/drawable/`
4. **Animation automatically works** - no code changes needed

### Add New Events:
1. **Add to `EventDatabase.java`** in the static initialization block
2. **Implement effect** in `Event.executeEvent()` method
3. **Handle SharedPreferences** in GameActivity if the event needs to save data
4. **Update event selection logic** in `getEventForStage()` if using special conditions

## üêõ Bug Fixes Applied

### 1. Squire Passive Bug (FIXED)
**Problem**: Squire passives weren't being applied to fighter
**Solution**: Implemented PassiveManager system with proper passive stacking

### 2. Duplicate Knights Bug (FIXED)
**Problem**: Same knight appearing multiple times in collection
**Solution**: Added `fixDuplicateKnights()` method in MainActivity

### 3. Mass Evolution Bug (FIXED)
**Problem**: Mass evolution only evolved first knight, others lost duplicates
**Solution**: Fixed `massEvolveKnights()` to update `owned_knights` string for each knight

### 4. Attack Spam Exploitation (FIXED)
**Problem**: Players could spam attack buttons to kill enemies rapidly
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive button state management with immediate disabling and safe re-enabling

### 5. Enemy Size and Positioning (FIXED)
**Problem**: Enemy character too large and poorly positioned
**Solution**: Adjusted enemy size to 300x350dp and improved positioning with -100dp margin

### 6. Enemy Animation System (ADDED)
**Problem**: Only player had attack animations
**Solution**: Implemented complete enemy animation system with `enemy_idle.png` and `enemy_attack.png`

## üåç Internationalization & RTL Support

### Hebrew Language Support (RTL) - RESOLVED
**Challenge Identified**: Hebrew language users experiencing flipped battle layout
- **Issue**: Android automatically mirrors layouts for Right-to-Left languages
- **Symptom**: Player appears on right side, enemy on left side (reversed from intended)
- **Root Cause**: Hebrew is RTL language, causing LinearLayout with `layout_weight` to flip

**Solution Implemented**: Global RTL Disable
- **Method**: Added `android:supportsRtl="false"` to AndroidManifest.xml
- **Result**: Application no longer supports RTL layout mirroring
- **Impact**: Consistent battle layout across all languages and locales
- **Trade-off**: Hebrew text still displays correctly, but UI layout remains Left-to-Right

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Battle positioning now consistent regardless of device language

### RTL Testing Methods:
- Hebrew locale emulator testing
- Developer options "Force RTL layout direction"
- Physical device language switching to Hebrew (◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™)

---

*Last Updated: Added automated README-to-PDF generation with Dropbox sync, fixed Hebrew RTL layout issue, added enemy animation system, fixed mass evolution bug, implemented attack spam prevention, and improved character positioning*
*Status: Fully functional game with comprehensive animation system, robust anti-cheat measures, consistent cross-language layout compatibility, and automated documentation pipeline - ready for advanced feature development and global deployment*
